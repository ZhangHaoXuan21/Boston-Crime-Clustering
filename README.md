# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and cluster crime data in Boston from 2017 to 2022 based on longitude and latitude coordinates. 
By employing advanced data cleaning techniques and exploratory data analysis, the project seeks to uncover meaningful insights into crime trends over time. 
Additionally, a fuzzy c-means clustering model is utilized to identify criminal hotspots within the city.

# Project Highlight
- Data Cleaning Techniques: Employed hot deck imputation and cold deck imputation to handle missing values in the crime dataset effectively.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth EDA on the cleaned dataset to reveal insights such as yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly crime trends. Additionally, identified crimes that occur exclusively during specific years, months, days, and hours.

- Fuzzy C-Means Clustering: Trained a fuzzy c-means clustering model with a Davies-Bouldin index of 0.7631 to cluster crimes in Boston from 2017 to 2022. Successfully identified new criminal hotspots, particularly focusing on areas with the highest shooting frequency.
